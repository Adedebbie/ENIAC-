# ENIAC-data_exploration- 
The aim of this project is to ascertain if it is beneficial to discount products or not.
## About the project
As the data analyst for the e-commerce tech company, I will be analysing the data to give insights as to whether it is beneficial to discount products or not. I will be presenting the result of my analysis to the company board

# Business aspect of the project
I will be providing clarity on the following aspect:
- How products should be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis.
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories.
- How many products are being discounted.
- How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices.
- How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales.
- How could data collection be improved.
